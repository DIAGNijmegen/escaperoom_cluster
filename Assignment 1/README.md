# Assignment 1

We provide each participant with a template Dockerfile and a list of packages required.
They first have to update the Dockerfile with a step that install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
Then, they need to build the docker image and push it to the registry.

## Pass the assignment

The assignment is passed once they push the updated Dockerfile to their github repository.
We will doublecheck the image is available on our registry.
